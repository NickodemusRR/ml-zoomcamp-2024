# ML Zoomcamp 2024 

This repo contains my learning from ML Zoomcamp [cohort 2024](!https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master/cohorts/2024) by [DataTalks.Club](!https://datatalks.club/).

Week 3 - [Machine Learning Classification](<./03-Classification/classification.ipynb>) 
<br>This week, we learned about classification using logistic regression. Weight observation for logistic regression is similar to linear regression, except we add the sigmoid function at the end.


Week 4 - [Evaluation Metric](<./04-Evaluation/evaluation.ipynb>)
<br>This week, we learned about different metrics commonly used to evaluate classification model performance.

Week 5 - [Deployment](<./05-Deployment/deployment.ipynb>)
<br>We learned about deployment to deploy our model, which can be used outside our local environment.

Week 6 - [Trees](<./06-Trees/tree.ipynb>)
<br>Learning about tree-based machine learning model.
