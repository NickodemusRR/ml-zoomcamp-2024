# ML Zoomcamp 2024 

This repo contains my learning from ML Zoomcamp [cohort 2024](!https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master/cohorts/2024) by [DataTalks.Club](!https://datatalks.club/).

Week 3 - Machine Learning Classification 
This week, we learned about classification using logistic regression. Weight observation for logistic regression is similar to that with linear regression, except we add the sigmoid function at the end.
