# ML Zoomcamp 2024 Week 3 - Machine Learning Classification

Homework for [DataTalks.Club](!https://datatalks.club/) ML Zoomcamp [cohort 2024](!https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master/cohorts/2024).

This week, we learned about classification using logistic regression. Weight observation for logistic regression is similar to that with linear regression, except we add the sigmoid function at the end.
