# ML Zoomcamp 2024 

This repo contains my learning from ML Zoomcamp [cohort 2024](!https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master/cohorts/2024) by [DataTalks.Club](!https://datatalks.club/).

Week 3 - [Machine Learning Classification](<./03 - Classification/classification.ipynb>) 
<br>This week, we learned about classification using logistic regression. Weight observation for logistic regression is similar to linear regression, except we add the sigmoid function at the end.


Week 4 - [Evaluation Metric](<./04 - Evaluation/classification.ipynb>)
<br>This week, we learned about different metrics commonly used to evaluate classification model performance.
